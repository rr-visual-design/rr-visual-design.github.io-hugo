description: The 2014 season for the Marion Harding Marching Band was a special one, also it was the first show that Nick and Tim worked together on a program. Revamping the color guard program was a key goal this year, and it set the stage for this school's future success. Combined with some stunning visual effects, Marion Harding Marching Band recieved a "Superior" rating at OMEA State Competition.
