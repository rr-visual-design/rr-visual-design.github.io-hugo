description: The 2015 season was a record-shattering season for the Marion Harding Marching Band. In addition to recieving "Grand Champion" at *every* regular competition they attended, and recieving a "Superior" rating at OMEA State Competition, the 2015 Marion Harding Marching Band competed at the Outback Bowl competition and won the opportunity to perform during halftime of the nationally-televised 2016 Outback Bowl. 2015 was a truly undefeated season for this remarkable band.
