description: Harding's 2016 production, <em>From the Depths</em>, was a long collaborative effort between Radford Visual Design and the staff at Marion Harding High School. From conception to completion, the project lasted 8 months. Using the fantastic music of Francis McBeth to set up the story of Captain Ahab vs. Moby Dick, we created the flags, curated the narration, and set the drill to create this fast-paced and effective show. Yet again, this band qualified for state finals competition at their first show of the season.
